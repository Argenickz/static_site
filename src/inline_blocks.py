! split Blocks
Our static site generator only cares about two things:
. Inline markdown
. block markdown

Inline markdown  is what we just took care of. It's the stuff that's inside of a block. For example the (bolded) text in this sentence is inline markdown.

Block-level markdown is just the separation of different sections of an entire document.
